Q1. My partner and I want to come by each of the stores in person and meet the managers. 
Please send over the managers’ names at each store, with the full address 
of each property
 

Q2. I would like to get a better understanding of all of the inventory that would come along with the business. 
Please pull together a list of each inventory item you have stocked, including the store_id number, 
the inventory_id, the name of the film, the film’s rating, its rental rate and replacement cost. 

Q3. we want to understand how diversified the inventory is in terms of replacement cost. We want to 
see how big of a hit it would be if a certain category of film became unpopular at a certain store.
We would like to see the number of films, as well as the average replacement cost, and total replacement cost, 
sliced by store and film category. 

Q4.We want to make sure you folks have a good handle on who your customers are. Please provide a list 
of all customer names, which store they go to, whether or not they are currently active, 
and their full addresses – street address, city, and country. 

Q5.We're interested in how well you have covered the most-awarded actors. 
Of all the actors with three types of awards, for what % of them do we carry a film?
And how about for actors with two types of awards? Same questions. 
Finally, how about actors with just one award?
